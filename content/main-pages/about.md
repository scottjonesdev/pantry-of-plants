Hi, my name is Scott and I went vegan in December 2019. I went Vegan because I love animals and no longer wanted to contribute to their suffering. Prior to my lifestyle change I spent 6 years working in a commercial kitchen as a line cook. 

I decided to make this website to share some of my vegan recipes with the world. Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions or feedback regarding my content. 

Note: Baking is my culinary passion, as a result, most of my recipes are for baked goods. These recipes are not designed to be healthy (though some of them are). They are simply meant to be delicious.
