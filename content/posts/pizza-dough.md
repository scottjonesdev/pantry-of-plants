##Description
For several years I worked as a line cook that made wood fire pizzas. This dough recipe is a modified and significantly scaled down version of the dough recipe I used to make at work. It is strong enough to be stretched in the traditional Italian way. You can also roll it out with a rolling pin if that’s what you are comfortable with.

At home I like to cook my pizzas on a Barbecue using a pizza stone. It yields results very close to a wood fire oven. That being said, this recipe also works great being baked on a sheet pan baked in a regular oven too.

##Ingredients (Yields 2 thin crust pizzas)
- 1 tsp Yeast
- 3 tsp Sugar
- 175ml Warm Water
- 1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1 1/2 Cups Flour
- 1/4 tsp Salt

##Instructions
1. Add Yeast and Sugar to Large Mixing Bowl or Stand Mixer if you have one.
2. Add warm water to sugar and yeast mixture and give it a few stirs.
3. Let the yeast proof for approximately 5 minutes. (It should look foamy when it's done).
4. Add Olive Oil, flour and salt to mixing bowl. 
5. Mix / knead ingredients until bowl is clean.[^1]
6. Grease a sheet pan with Olive Oil.
7. Once dough is adequately kneaded separate into 2 even balls and place on sheet pan. Cover dough with a kitchen towel until double in size.
8. Once doubled, you are ready to stretch or roll out your doughs and make some pizza!
