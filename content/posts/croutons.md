##Description
Croutons are a great way to repurpose old bread. They are quick, easy to make, and delicious! I like to use mine in <a href="kale-salad.md.html" target="_blank">Kale salad</a>. 

##Ingredients
- Bread (Any bread will do!)
- Olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper
- Garlic powder

##Instructions
1. Heat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Slice up bread into cubes.
3. Place bread cubes on non-stick sheet pan.
4. Cover bread with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
5. Bake croutons in oven until brown. I recommend flipping or mixing around the bread pieces halfway through the bake.[^1]
6. Once brown, turn off oven and let croutons harden for 5 minutes.
7. Remove croutons from oven and let them cool.
8. Once cool, store in an airtight container. I like to store mine in a Mason Jar.

***

[^1]: I find the bake time varies based on how dense the bread you are using is. Airy bread can take closer to 5 minutes while denser bread can take closer to 10 minutes. Rather than setting a timer, I recommend keeping an eye on the bread as it bakes.
