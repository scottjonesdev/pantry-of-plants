##Description 
One of my favourite baked goods. They make a lovely treat for brunch. 

##Ingredients (Dough)
- 1 cup plant milk (soy, oat, almond)
- 1/4 Cup vegan yogurt or 1/4 Cup applesauce[^1]
- 3 Cups all purpose flour
- 3 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 Tsp salt
- 4 Tbsp vegan butter (or coconut oil)
- 1 1/2 Tsp active dry yeast or fast rise yeast

##Ingredients (Filling / Topping)
- Ground cinnamon 
- Brown sugar
- Melted vegan butter (or coconut oil)
- Coconut oil (to grease baking dish)

##Instructions

###If you have a bread machine…

If you have a bread machine you can load it with the dough ingredients and set your machine to its ‘dough’ mode. Your dough will be ready in about 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending on your machine. If you are using a bread machine please use ‘Fast Rise Yeast’. 

***

###Don’t have a bread maker? Follow these steps!

1. Warm almond milk in a small pot on your stove.
2. While almond milk is warming, add yeast and sugar to your stand mixer or large mixing bowl.
3. Once almond milk is warm, add it to the yeast and sugar mixture. Give it a few stirs and let it sit for 5 minutes to activate the yeast. 
4. Once your mixture is looking frothy, add melted vegan butter, vegan yogurt, flour, and salt.
5. Mix / knead ingredients until bowl is clean. Approximately 5-10 minutes.
6. Once the dough is kneaded, place it in a bowl that is greased with vegan butter or coconut oil and cover it. I use a bowl that has a lid. A kitchen towel, or saran wrap will also work. 
7. Let dough rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

###Once your dough is ready...

1. Roll out dough into a large rectangle on a lightly floured surface. 
2. Cover dough with melted vegan butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. <img src="images/recipe-images/cinnamon-bun-rolled-out.JPG" class="image-in-recipe" id="recipe-image" alt="Cinnamon bun dough rolled out">

[^1]: Vegan yogurt makes a great egg substitute. It is my go to replacement for recipes like this. I use [Riviera: Coconut Milk Vegan, Plain](https://vegansupply.ca/products/riviera-natural-flavour-yogurt-650g) for baking. Applesauce will also work in this recipe.
