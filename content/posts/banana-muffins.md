##Description
This recipe is adapted from my great grandmother’s Banana Loaf recipe. It Works great as a loaf or muffins. No need for a proper egg substitute in this recipe as the bananas accomplish this on their own. For the oil I strongly recommend using Coconut Oil as it yields a buttery flavour and texture. 

##Ingredients
- 1/4 cup Oil (Coconut or other)
- 1 cup Sugar
- 3 or 4 bananas (depending on size: 3 large or 4 small) Approx: 1 cup
- 1/2 cup white flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking soda
- Vegan 'Dairy Free' chocolate chips (optional)[^2]

##Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Add Oil and Sugar to large mixing bowl.
3. Cream oil and sugar.
4. Mash Bananas in separate smaller bowl.
5. Add mashed banana and baking soda to the oil and sugar mix.
6. Add flour and salt.
7. Mix ingredients by hand until combined. Avoid over-mixing.
8. Add chocolate chips if desired.
9. Grease Muffin Pan or Loaf pan with Coconut Oil.
10. Add muffin batter to pan.
11. Bake until brown on top and firm to the touch.[^1]

[^1]:For muffins bake approx 25-30 minutes.
	For Loaf bake approx 50-60 minutes.


	Note: Your cooking time may vary based on your oven.

[^2]:For Vegan chocolate chips I recommend reading the ingredients rather than looking for ones that are advertised as Vegan. Most semi-sweet chocolate chips other than ‘Chipits’ are dairy free. Bakers semi-sweet is a good option. Enjoy Life are a good option if you need to avoid other potential allergens like soy. Personally I find them overpriced compared to grocery store house brands or Bakers.
