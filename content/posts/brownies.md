##Description
A classic treat reinvented without the needless dairy or egg. I enjoy paring these with vegan ice cream. My favourite to pair it with is the [So Delicious salted caramel cluster](https://shop.sodeliciousdairyfree.com/products/salted-caramel-cluster-cashewmilk-frozen-dessert). 

##Ingredients
- 1/4 Cup coconut oil
- 1/4 Cup vegan butter
- 1 Cup sugar (granulated, brown, or a mix)
- 1/2 Cup plain vegan yogurt or 1/2 Cup plant milk (soy, oat, almond)[^1]
- 2/3 Cup all purpose flour
- 1/2 Cup cocoa
- 1/2 Tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 Cup chocolate chips (optional)[^2]

##Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Grease an 8x8x2 inch baking pan with coconut oil.
3. Add Coconut Oil, Vegan Butter, Sugar and sugar to large mixing bowl. Cream ingredients until combined.
4. Add Flour, Cocoa, Baking Powder and salt. Mix until combined. 
5. Add chocolate chips and fold them in to the mixture.
6. Add brownie batter to prepared baking pan.
7. Bake for 25-35 minutes. Brownies should be slightly firm to the touch when they are ready. You can use a cake tester or toothpick to check they are fully baked if you have one. 
8. Let brownies cool then remove them from the pan.

[^1]: Vegan Yogurt makes a great egg substitute. It is my go to replacement for recipes like this. I use [Riviera: Coconut Milk Vegan, Plain](https://vegansupply.ca/products/riviera-natural-flavour-yogurt-650g) for baking. If you don’t have vegan yogurt on hand, a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed meal with 3 tbsp of water) should also work fine in this recipe. 

[^2]:For Vegan chocolate chips I recommend reading the ingredients rather than looking for ones that are advertised as Vegan. Most semi-sweet chocolate chips other than ‘Chipits’ are dairy free. Bakers semi-sweet is a good option. Enjoy Life are a good option if you need to avoid other potential allergens like soy. Personally I find them overpriced compared to grocery store house brands or Bakers.
