***

[^1]: I find that a flax egg works great for this recipe. However, if you prefer to use other egg substitutes like vegan yogurt or banana they should also work fine.

[^2]: They should still be soft in the centre but firm enough to lightly tap without significant compression. They will firm up significantly as they cool.
