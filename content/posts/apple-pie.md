##Description
This recipe is based on the recipe my grandpa makes; just altered to be vegan friendly. If possible, I like to make it with apples harvested off his tree.

###Pie Crust / Pastry

##Ingredients (Yields a 9 inch 2 crust pie)
- 2/3 Cup Vegetable Shortening
- 2 Tbsp Vegan Butter
- 2 Cups All Purpose Flour
- 1 Tsp Salt
- 5 to 6 Tbsp Cold Water

##Instructions
1. Place shortening and vegan butter in freezer to chill it down.[^1]
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
3. Once shortening and vegan butter is cold and firm (almost frozen), remove from freezer and use a cheese grater to grate these two ingredients into the flour and salt mixture. 
4. Once the chilled ingredients are loosely mixed into the dry ingredients, add cold water.
6. Mix in water by turning mixture with one, then two fingers, eventually using your whole hand to collect all the ingredients into a ball.[^2]
6. Divide pastry into two separate balls, cover in saran wrap or eco-friendly alternative and chill in fridge until you are ready to make the rest of the pie.[^3]

###Apple Pie (9 Inch Pie)

##Ingredients
- Pastry (prepared above) 
- 1/2 Cup Brown Sugar
- 1/4 Cup Granulated Sugar
- 1/4 Cup All Purpose Flour
- 1/8 Tsp Salt
- 1 Tsp Ground Nutmeg
- 1 Tsp Ground Cinnamon
- 6 Cups of sliced and peeled apples. I find this is usually around 6 average apples. You will need more if your apples are small.
- 2 Tbsp Vegan Butter
- A little bit of Almond Milk and Granulated Sugar (This is to brush on the top of the pie)

##Instructions
1. Heat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. In a large mixing bowl mix brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vegan butter.
3. Peel and thinly slice apples and add them to the mixing bowl.
4. Toss or stir apples into the other ingredients.
5. Roll out first pastry ball on a floured surface. Fold pastry over rolling pin using a bench knife. Use rolling pin to pick up the pastry and place it on the your pie dish.[^3]
6. Trim the edges off the pastry and add the apple mixture. If you have the correct amount of apples it should sit flush with the top of the pie.
7. Roll out your second pastry ball and place it on top of your pie. Seal and flute the edges.
8. Cut 3 slits in the top pastry, lightly brush crust with almond milk and sprinkle with granulated sugar.
9. Cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foil. This will prevent the edges from burning.â€¨
10. Bake pie for 50 minutes, then remove aluminum foil from sides.
11. Bake your pie until it is lightly brown. Approximately 10 more minutes.
