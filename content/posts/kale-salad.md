[^1]: This recipe is for an individual portion. Scale the recipe up as needed to serve more people.

[^2]: How much Kale you use is up to you. I like to use several small leaves of Kale or a couple large leaves. 

[^3]: I put several options here as I like to vary how I make this salad on a regular basis. Lemon juice is probably my favourite variation. 

[^4]: Add salt and pepper to taste. 

[^5]: Add dressing gradually until you have the correct amount to your preference. If the flavour is too weak, make another batch of dressing and continue to add gradually to the kale.
