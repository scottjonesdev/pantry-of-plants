##Description
Based off my <a href="pizza-dough.md.html" target="_blank">Pizza Dough</a> recipe, this is a quick way to make a focaccia style loaf. I like pairing it with soup or pasta. 

##Ingredients (Yields 1 loaf)
- 1 tsp Yeast
- 3 tsp Sugar
- 175ml Warm Water
- 1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1 1/2 Cups Flour
- 1/4 tsp Salt

##Instructions
1. Add Yeast and Sugar to Large Mixing Bowl or Stand Mixer if you have one.
2. Add warm water to sugar and yeast mixture and give it a few stirs.
3. Let the yeast proof for approximately 5 minutes. (It should look foamy when it's done).
4. Add Olive Oil, flour and salt to mixing bowl. 
5. Mix / knead ingredients until bowl is clean.[^1]
6. Grease a medium to large mixing bowl with Olive Oil.
7. Once dough is adequately kneaded place in mixing bowl and cover with a kitchen towel or lid.
9. Grease a sheet pan or a cast iron pan with olive oil. Sprinkle with cornmeal. 
8. Once doubled, stretch out dough with your hands and place on cast iron or sheet pan to bake.
9. Let dough rise for 20-60 minutes.
10. Cover dough with olive oil and herbs of choice (I like to use a mix of Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, Oregano, Basil, Thyme, and Rosemary).
11. Bake for 20-30 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
