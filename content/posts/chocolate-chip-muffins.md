##Description
Simple and delicious Vegan Buttermilk Chocolate Chip Muffins. Adapted from the non-vegan version my mom used to make for me when I was a kid. For this recipe we are using Vegan Yogurt as our egg substitute!

##Ingredients
- 3/4 Cup Almond Milk [^1]
- 1 tbsp White Vinegar or Apple Cider Vinegar
- 1/2 Cup Oil (Coconut or other)
- 1/3 Cup Sugar
- 1/4 Cup Plain Vegan Yogurt [^2]
- 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
- 1/2 Cup Whole Wheat Flour [^3]
- 1 1/2 Cup White Flour
- 3 tsp Baking Powder
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1 Cup Vegan 'Dairy Free' chocolate chips [^4]

##Instructions
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Measure Almond Milk and Vinegar and combine. Let this mixture rest for 5 minutes. This will create a ‘Vegan Buttermilk’.
3. Grease Muffin Pan with Coconut Oil.
4. Add Coconut Oil and sugar to large mixing bowl. Mix until combined.
5. Add Vegan Yogurt, and Almond Milk / Vinegar mixture to mixing bowl and mix until combined.
6. Add Flour, Baking Powder, and Salt to mixing bowl.
7. Mix ingredients by hand until combined. Avoid over-mixing.
8. Add Chocolate Chips.
9. Add muffin batter to pan.
10. Sprinkle the muffin tops with brown sugar (optional).
11. Bake muffins approximately 35 minutes or until golden brown.

[^1]: I like to use [Califia Unsweetened Almond](https://vegansupply.ca/products/califia-farms-unsweetened-almond-milk-1-4l) for baking as it lacks fortification. In my experience, fortified milks can impact the baking chemistry and yield unpredictable results. That being said, any plant milk should work. I have also successfully used Earth’s Own Oat Milk for this recipe in the past.

[^2]: Vegan Yogurt makes a great egg substitute. It is my go to replacement for recipes like this. I use [Riviera: Coconut Milk Vegan, Plain](https://vegansupply.ca/products/riviera-natural-flavour-yogurt-650g) for baking. If you don’t have vegan yogurt on hand, a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed meal with 3 tbsp of water) should also work fine in this recipe.

[^3]: I like to make this recipe with part white flour, part whole wheat. You can make it entirely with white flour if you prefer.

[^4]:For Vegan chocolate chips I recommend reading the ingredients rather than looking for ones that are advertised as Vegan. Most semi-sweet chocolate chips other than ‘Chipits’ are dairy free. Bakers semi-sweet is a good option. Enjoy Life are a good option if you need to avoid other potential allergens like soy. Personally I find them overpriced compared to grocery store house brands or Bakers.
