##Description
Simple and delicious Vegan Buttermilk Chocolate Chip Muffins. Adapted from the non-vegan version my mom used to make for me when I was a kid. For this recipe we are using Vegan Yogurt as our egg substitute!

##Ingredients
- 3/4 Cup plan milk (soy, oat, almond)
- 1 tbsp white vinegar or apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 Cup oil (Coconut or other)
- 1/3 Cup sugar
- 1/4 Cup plain vegan yogurt [^1]
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 Cup whole wheat flour [^2]
- 1 1/2 Cup white flour
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 Cup vegan 'dairy free' chocolate chips [^3]

##Instructions
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Measure Almond Milk and Vinegar and combine. Let this mixture rest for 5 minutes. This will create a ‘Vegan Buttermilk’.
3. Grease Muffin Pan with Coconut Oil.
4. Add Coconut Oil and sugar to large mixing bowl. Mix until combined.
5. Add Vegan Yogurt, and Almond Milk / Vinegar mixture to mixing bowl and mix until combined.
6. Add Flour, Baking Powder, and Salt to mixing bowl.
7. Mix ingredients by hand until combined. Avoid over-mixing.
8. Add Chocolate Chips.
9. Add muffin batter to pan.
10. Sprinkle the muffin tops with brown sugar (optional).
11. Bake muffins approximately 35 minutes or until golden brown.

[^1]: Vegan Yogurt makes a great egg substitute. It is my go to replacement for recipes like this. I use [Riviera: Coconut Milk Vegan, Plain](https://vegansupply.ca/products/riviera-natural-flavour-yogurt-650g) for baking. If you don’t have vegan yogurt on hand, a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed meal with 3 tbsp of water) should also work fine in this recipe.

[^2]: I like to make this recipe with part white flour, part whole wheat. You can make it entirely with white flour if you prefer.

[^3]:For Vegan chocolate chips I recommend reading the ingredients rather than looking for ones that are advertised as Vegan. Most semi-sweet chocolate chips other than ‘Chipits’ are dairy free. Bakers semi-sweet is a good option. Enjoy Life are a good option if you need to avoid other potential allergens like soy. Personally I find them overpriced compared to grocery store house brands or Bakers.
