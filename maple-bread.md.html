    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for a single loaf of whole wheat bread. This recipe is quick and easy! We will use the oven to do our dough rise which will save both time and effort.</p>

    <h2 id="ingredients-1-loaf">Ingredients (1 loaf)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 Tablespoon Active Dry Yeast or Traditional Yeast</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Maple Syrup or Sugar (any form of sugar will work)</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 Cups or 425ml Warm Water</li>
      <li>50ml (approx 1/6 cup) of Olive Oil</li>
      <li>2 cups Whole Wheat Flour</li>
      <li>1 and 3/4 cups White Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 Tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>Extra Olive Oil and Salt to spread on top of bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oven to 200 degrees fahrenheit. Warm a standard sized loaf pan (approx 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 x 2-1/2 inches – cast iron or non stick) in oven. Add Olive oil and cornmeal to the bottom of the pan.</li>
      <li>Add yeast and sweetener of choice (sugar or maple syrup) to mixing bowl. Poor in warm water and give the mixture a few stirs. Let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes. (It should look foamy when it’s done).</li>
      <li>Add the Olive Oil to the wet mixture.</li>
      <li>Add the flour and salt to a large mixing bowl or stand mixer if you have one.</li>
      <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry.</li>
      <li>If using a stand mixer, knead the dough for about 5 minutes. If you are kneading by hand it should take around 100 to 200 turns.</li>
      <li>Place a little oil on your hands and shape dough into a loaf. Add 3 diagonal score marks to the top of the loaf. Cover load with Olive Oil and salt and place the pan in the warm oven to rise. After 20 minutes it should be doubled in size.</li>
      <li>After the 20 minutes, turn oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Leave bread in oven and set your timer for 35 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once the bread is golden brown it is done. Remove the loaf from the oven, brush top with Olive Oil, remove from pan and cool on a cooling rack.</li>
      <li>Enjoy :)</li>
